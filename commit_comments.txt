I am committing a bunch of stuff I have been working on for the data science specialization.

The changes are mostly about adding the ability to predict the next word, and then about speeding things up.

- Computing histograms of ngrams, which can be saved and then reloaded later.
- the prediction module for making predictions.
- the vector_utils module for stuff dealing with word vectors.
- There are a lot of functions that do the same thing in slightly different ways, because I was doing a lot of
performance testing.
- One result of the investigation into performance was computing a map of all the indexes, or indices I guess, of the
ngram histograms that contain a certain start (all the words except the last), because the function that searched the
ngram histogram (predictions.match_n_grams_one_hist()) was a little slow.


A couple of notes:
- A bunch of files created and referenced in the unit tests are not committed because they are so huge.
- I plan to remove many of the duplicate functions and keep the ones that were shown to be faster.
